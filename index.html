        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a Psychology Student at the University of California, Riverside. I am a fourth-year student, and I have been working as an Undergraduate Research Assistant for the past three years in cognitive neuroscience labs under two different professors. I conduct various types of psychological research, and has been sent to research abroad on a grant by the National Science Foundation. My titles include Research Assistant Trainer and EEG Supervisor. I enjoy collecting data, interacting with different clients, and presenting the data at conferences or symposiums. Working under several graduate students between two research labs has taught me how to adjust to different work habits and how to keep up with different tasks from each researcher. As a student, it is difficult to keep up with both school work, academic performance, and research at the same time in some instances.
During my stay at the Netherlands, I lived with another research assistant from my lab. We were sent there on a grant to conduct individual research projects specializing in EEG findings. We got to see a different part of the world than what we were used to. We met a local friend, who is not a researcher at the University of Groningen, which is also where our lab was affiliated to. Not only were we able to experience research in a totally different setting, we also got to see different Dutch traditions. We traveled to different cities like Amsterdam, attended a traditional PhD defense, and immersed in their culture in the small town. It was an unforgettable experience, and it is something that I am so grateful of for being given this chance. I have personally met so many important figures in the psychology field, as well as worked with researchers working on interesting topics. After we came back from the trip, the two of us along with a few other research assistants who were also sent abroad had to prepare for one poster presentation and a research abroad presentation to show what we have accomplished from this trip. This is when I discovered my passion for research, and have since then decided to pursue a career in the psychological research field.
I have learned a lot in the past four years at the University of California, Riverside. I came in as an inexperienced teenager to a young adult with a broader mind, experience, and a goal for the future. Having gained experience in both school or work related skills as well as personal growth, I have gained insight in many other perspectives. For instance, I learned to understand mental health concerns as uncontrollable and may severely affect oneâ€™s life. Higher education also taught me important skills on top of academic discipline, such as time management, leadership, interpersonal socialization skills, and importance of stepping out of my comfort zone. Also, it is because of the resources given by this school that I was able to attend this class and learn basic knowledge in computer science, which is something that I have never expected myself to learn when I first entered the school.
